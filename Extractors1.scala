/*
An extractor in Scala is an object that has a method called unapply as one of its members. The purpose of that unapply method is to match a value and take it apart. Often, the extractor object also defines a dual method apply for building values, but this is not required.

Example
Let us take an example of object defines both apply and unapply methods. The apply method has the same meaning as always: it turns Test into an object that can be applied to arguments in parentheses in the same way a method is applied. So you can write Test ("Zara", "gmail.com") to construct the string "Zara@gmail.com".

The unapply method is what turns Test class into an extractor and it reverses the construction process of apply. Where apply takes two strings and forms an email address string out of them, unapply takes an email address and returns potentially two strings: the user and the domain of the address.

The unapply must also handle the case where the given string is not an email address. That's why unapply returns an Option-type over pairs of strings. Its result is either Some (user, domain) if the string str is an email address with the given user and domain parts, or None, if str is not an email address.

   def main(args: Array[String]) {

      println ("Unapply method : " + unapply("Zara@gmail.com"));
      println ("Unapply method : " + unapply("Zara Ali"));
   }
   
   // The injection method (optional)
   def apply(user: String, domain: String) = {
      user +"@"+ domain
   }

   // The extraction method (mandatory)
   def unapply(str: String): Option[(String, String)] = {
      val parts = str split "@"
      
      if (parts.length == 2){
         Some(parts(0), parts(1)) 
      } else {
         None
      }
   }
